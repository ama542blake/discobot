# DiscoBot
Discobot is a bot for Discord that builds a playlist based on songs that are sent via Discord. This project is still in the design phase, so more details will be added here as they are determined.

## Supported Platforms
Currently, Spotify is the only platform supported. This means that you can only use it to build playlists on Spotify, and you can only build this playlist by sending song links. Once I establish the core functionality with Spotify, I would like to at least add support for YouTube.

## How Do I Set Up Discobot?
That's a good question. This is still very much up in the air.
